<div id="styling-concepts" class="docs-heading">
	<h3>Styling concepts</h3>
	<p>There are 3 questions to keep in mind while customizing the styles of Angular Material components:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Are your styles encapsulated?</li>
		<li>Are your styles more specific than the defaults?</li>
		<li>Is the component a child of your component, or does it exist elsewhere in the <code class="docs-code">DOM</code>?</li>
	</ol>
	<div id="view-encapsulation" class="docs-heading">
		<h4>View encapsulation</h4>
		<p>By default, Angular component styles are scoped to affect the component's view. This means that the styles you write will affect all the elements in your component template. They will <em>not</em> affect elements that are children of other components within your template. You can read more about view encapsulation in the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/component-styles#view-encapsulation" target="_blank">Angular documentation</a>. You may also wish to take a look at <a href="https://blog.angular.io/the-state-of-css-in-angular-4a52d4bd2700"><em>The State of <code class="docs-code">CSS</code> in Angular</em></a> on the Angular blog.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="selector-specificity" class="docs-heading">
		<h4>Selector specificity</h4>
		<p>Each CSS declaration has a level of <em>specificity</em> based on the type and number of selectors used. More specific styles will take precedence over less specific styles. Angular Material uses the least specific selectors possible for its components in order to make it easy to override them. You can read more about specificity and how it is calculated on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity">MDN web docs</a>.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="component-location" class="docs-heading">
		<h4>Component location</h4>
		<p>Some Angular Material components, specifically overlay-based ones like <code class="docs-code">MatDialog</code>, <code class="docs-code">MatSnackbar</code>, etc., do not exist as children of your component. Often they are injected elsewhere in the DOM. This is important to keep in mind, since even using high specificity and shadow-piercing selectors will not target elements that are not direct children of your component. Global styles are recommended for targeting such components.
	</div>
</div>
<div id="styling-overlay-components" class="docs-heading">
	<h3>Styling overlay components</h3>
	<p>Overlay-based components have a <code class="docs-code">panelClass</code> property (or similar) that can be used to target the overlay pane. For example, to remove the padding from a dialog:</p>
	<code-viewer language="scss">// Add this to your global stylesheet after your theme setup
		
.myapp-no-padding-dialog .mat-dialog-container &#123;
	padding: 0;
&#125;</code-viewer>
	<code-viewer language="typescript">this.dialog.open(MyDialogComponent, &#123; panelClass: 'myapp-no-padding-dialog'&#125;);</code-viewer>
	<p>Since you are adding the styles to your global stylesheet, it is good practice to scope them appropriately. Try prefixing your selector with your app name or <code class="docs-code">"custom"</code>. Also note that the <code class="docs-code">mat-dialog-container</code>'s padding is added by default via a selector with specificity of 1. The customizing styles have a specificity of 2, so they will always take precedence.</p>
</div>
<div id="styling-other-components">
	<h3>Styling other components</h3>
	<p>If your component has view encapsulation turned on (default), your component styles will only affect the top level children in your template. HTML elements belonging to child components cannot be targeted by your component styles unless you do one of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Add the overriding style to you global stylesheet. Scope the selectors so that it only affects the specific elements you need it to.</li>
		<li>Turn view encapsulation off on your component. If you do this, be sure to scope your styles appropriately, or else you may end up incidentally targeting other components elswhere in your application.</li>
		<li>Use a deprecated shadow-piercing descendant combinator to force styles to apply to all the child elements. Read more about this deprecated solution in the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/component-styles#deprecated-deep--and-ng-deep">Angular documentation</a>.</li>
	</ul>
