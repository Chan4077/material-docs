# Material2Docs

Welcome to `material2-docs` (unofficial)! This is basically the same as Angular's <https://material.angular.io>, but with more examples and a copy code button, along with app showcases (currently work in progress).

## Development server

You can develop locally by following these steps _(and make a pull request)_:

1. Execute the following code in your Terminal:
    
    ```bash
    npm install # Install dependencies
    npm run serve # Serves the app
    ```

    _(:exclamation: Did you know?)_ The script for `serve` will do a syntax highlight from the `examples/` folder, similar to how [Angular](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io/blob/master/tools/syntax-highlight.js) does it for their docs? ðŸ¤“
2. Navigate to `localhost:4200` for the app. Done!

## Contributing

And you may get a chance to contribute! :smile: :tada:
