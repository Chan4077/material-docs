<div class="docs-heading" id="what-is-a-theme">
	<h3>What is a theme?</h3>
	<p>A <strong>theme</strong> is the set of colors that will be applied to the Angular Material components. The library's approach to theming is based on the guidance from the <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-palette" matTooltip="Color specs" target="_blank" class="docs-link">Material Design spec</a>.</p>
	<p>In Angular Material, a theme is created by composing multiple palettes. In particular, a theme consists of:</p>
	<ul>
   	 	<li>A primary palette: colors most widely used across all screens and components.</li>
    	<li>An accent palette: colors used for the floating action button and interactive elements.</li>
    	<li>A warn palette: colors used to convey error state.</li>
    	<li>A foreground palette: colors for text and icons.</li>
    	<li>A background palette: colors used for element backgrounds.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In Angular Material, all theme styles are generated <em>statically</em> at build-time so that your app doesn't have to spend
    cycles generating theme styles on startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="docs-heading" id="using-a-pre-built-theme">
	<h3>Using a pre-built theme</h3>
	<p>Angular Material comes prepackaged with several pre-built theme css files. These theme files also include all of the styles for core (styles common to all components), so you only have to include a single css file for Angular Material in your app.</p>
	<p>You can include a theme file directly into your application from <code class="docs-code">@angular/material/prebuilt-themes</code></p>
	<p>Available pre-built themes:</p>
	<ul>
    	<li><code class="docs-code">deeppurple-amber.css</code></li>
    	<li><code class="docs-code">indigo-pink.css</code></li>
    	<li><code class="docs-code">pink-bluegrey.css</code></li>
    	<li><code class="docs-code">purple-green.css</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you're using Angular CLI, this is as simple as including one line in your <code class="docs-code">styles.css</code> file:</p>
	<code-viewer language="css">@import '~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/deeppurple-amber.css';</code-viewer>
	<p>Alternatively, you can just reference the file directly. This would look something like:</p>
	<code-viewer language="html">&lt;link href="node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code-viewer>
	<p>The actual path will depend on your server setup.</p>
	<p>You can also concatenate the file with the rest of your application's css.</p>
	<p>Finally, if your app's content <strong>is not</strong> placed inside of a <code class="docs-code">mat-sidenav-container</code> element, you need to add the <code class="docs-code">mat-app-background</code> class to your wrapper element (for example the <code class="docs-code">body</code>). This ensures that the proper theme background is applied to your page.</p>
</div>
<div class="docs-heading" id="define-a-custom-theme">
	<h3>Defining a custom theme</h3>
	<p>When you want more customization than a pre-built theme offers, you can create your own theme file.</p>
	<p>A custom theme file does two things:</p>
	<ol>
    	<li>Imports the <code class="docs-code">mat-core()</code> sass mixin. This includes all common styles that are used by multiple components. <strong>This should only be included once in your application.</strong> If this mixin is included multiple times, your application will end up with multiple copies of these common styles.</li>
		<li>Defines a <strong>theme</strong> data structure as the composition of multiple palettes. This object can be created with either the <code class="docs-code">mat-light-theme</code> function or the <code class="docs-code">mat-dark-theme</code> function. The output of this function is then passed to the <code class="docs-code">angular-material-theme</code> mixin, which will output all of the corresponding styles for the theme.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>A typical theme file will look something like this:</p>
	<code-viewer language="scss">@import '~@angular/material/theming';
// Plus imports for other components in your app.

// Include the common styles for Angular Material. We include this here so that you only
// have to load a single css file for Angular Material in your app.
// Be sure that you only ever include this mixin once!
@include mat-core();

// Define the palettes for your theme using the Material Design palettes available in palette.scss
// (imported above). For each palette, you can optionally specify a default, lighter, and darker
// hue.
$candy-app-primary: mat-palette($mat-indigo);
$candy-app-accent:  mat-palette($mat-pink, A200, A100, A400);

// The warn palette is optional (defaults to red).
$candy-app-warn:    mat-palette($mat-red);

// Create the theme object (a Sass map containing all of the palettes).
$candy-app-theme:   mat-light-theme($candy-app-primary, $candy-app-accent, $candy-app-warn);

// Include theme styles for core and each component used in your app.
// Alternatively, you can import and @include the theme mixins for each component
// that you are using.
@include angular-material-theme($candy-app-theme);</code-viewer>
	<p>You only need this single Sass file; you do not need to use Sass to style the rest of your app.</p>
	<p>If you are using the Angular CLI, support for compiling Sass to css is built-in; you only have to add a new entry to the <code class="docs-code">"styles"</code> array in <code class="docs-code">.angular-cli.json</code> pointing to the theme file (e.g., <code class="docs-code">unicorn-app-theme.scss</code>).</p>
	<p>If you're not using the Angular CLI, you can use any existing Sass tooling to build the file (such as gulp-sass or grunt-sass). The simplest approach is to use the <code class="docs-code">node-sass</code> CLI; you simply run:</p>
	<code-viewer language="bash"># The first param is the scss file, the second param is the css file to write to
node-sass src/unicorn-app-theme.scss dist/unicorn-app-theme.css</code-viewer>
	<p>and then include the output file in your index.html.</p>
	<p>The theme file <strong>should not</strong> be imported into other SCSS files. This will cause duplicate styles to be written into your CSS output. If you want to consume the theme definition object (e.g., <code class="docs-code">$candy-app-theme</code>) in other SCSS files, then the definition of the theme object should be broken into its own file, separate from the inclusion of the <code class="docs-code">mat-core</code> and <code class="docs-code">angular-material-theme</code> mixins.</p>
	<p>The theme file can be concatenated and minified with the rest of the application's css.</p>
	<p>Note that if you include the generated theme file in the <code class="docs-code">styleUrls</code> of an Angular component, those styles will be subject to that component's <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/component-styles.html#!#view-encapsulation">view encapsulation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="docs-heading" id="multiple-themes">
	<h4>Multiple themes</h4>
	<p>You can create multiple themes for your application by including the <code class="docs-code">angular-material-theme</code> mixin multiple times, where each inclusion is gated by an additional CSS class.</p>
	<p>Remember to only ever include the <code class="docs-code">@mat-core</code> mixin only once; it should not be included for each theme.</p>
</div>
<div class="docs-heading" id="example-multiple-themes">
	<h5>Example of defining multiple themes:</h5>
	<code-viewer language="scss">@import '~@angular/material/theming';
// Plus imports for other components in your app.

// Include the common styles for Angular Material. We include this here so that you only
// have to load a single css file for Angular Material in your app.
// **Be sure that you only ever include this mixin once!**
@include mat-core();

// Define the default theme (same as the example above).
$candy-app-primary: mat-palette($mat-indigo);
$candy-app-accent:  mat-palette($mat-pink, A200, A100, A400);
$candy-app-theme:   mat-light-theme($candy-app-primary, $candy-app-accent);

// Include the default theme styles.
@include angular-material-theme($candy-app-theme);


// Define an alternate dark theme.
$dark-primary: mat-palette($mat-blue-grey);
$dark-accent:  mat-palette($mat-amber, A200, A100, A400);
$dark-warn:    mat-palette($mat-deep-orange);
$dark-theme:   mat-dark-theme($dark-primary, $dark-accent, $dark-warn);

// Include the alternative theme styles inside of a block with a CSS class. You can make this
// CSS class whatever you want. In this example, any component inside of an element with
// `.unicorn-dark-theme` will be affected by this alternate dark theme instead of the default theme.
.unicorn-dark-theme &#123;
  @include angular-material-theme($dark-theme);
&#125;</code-viewer>
	<p>In the above example, any component inside of a parent with the <code class="docs-code">unicorn-dark-theme</code> class will use the dark theme, while other components will fall back to the default <code class="docs-code">$candy-app-theme</code>.</p>
	<p>You can include as many themes as you like in this manner. You can also <code class="docs-code">@include</code> the <code class="docs-code">angular-material-theme</code> in separate files and then lazily load them based on an end-user interaction (how to lazily load the CSS assets will vary based on your application).</p>
	<p>It's important to remember, however, that the <code class="docs-code">mat-core</code> mixin should only ever be included <em>once</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="docs-heading" id="multiple-themes-and-overlay-based-components">
	<h5>Multiple themes and overlay-based components</h5>
	<p>Since certain components (e.g. menu, select, dialog, etc.) are inside of a global overlay container, an additional step is required for those components to be affected by the theme's css class selector (<code class="docs-code">.unicorn-dark-theme</code> in the example above).</p>
	<p>To do this, you can specify a <code class="docs-code">themeClass</code> on the global overlay container. For the example above, this would look like:</p>
	<code-viewer language="typescript">import &#123;OverlayContainer&#125; from '@angular/material';

@NgModule(&#123;
  // ...
&#125;)
export class UnicornCandyAppModule &#123;
  constructor(overlayContainer: OverlayContainer) &#123;
    overlayContainer.themeClass = 'unicorn-dark-theme';
  &#125;
&#125;</code-viewer>

	<p>The <code class="docs-code">themeClass</code> of the <code class="docs-code">OverlayContainer</code> can be changed at any time to change the active theme class.</p>
</div>
<div class="docs-heading" id="theming-only-certain-components">
	<h4>Theming only certain components</h4>
	<p>The <code class="docs-code">angular-material-theme</code> mixin will output styles for <a href="https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/src/lib/core/theming/_all-theme.scss" class="docs-link" matTooltip="View file">all components in the library</a>.</p>
    <p>If you are only using a subset of the components (or if you want to change the theme for specific components), you can include component-specific theme mixins. You also will need to include the <code class="docs-code">mat-core-theme</code> mixin as well, which contains theme-specific styles for common behaviors (such as ripples).</p>
